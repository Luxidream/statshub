# Introduction

Hi! This is a vignette file for my MATH 4753 class. It demonstrates functionality of the four functions that I included from the assignments this year.

You can read about the functionality of each function in its original documentation. The numbering is unusual to distinguish it from the original functions when I was submitting them as part of the labs.

# Demonstration

```{r setup, echo=FALSE}
library(luxipackage)

#Adjusting the size of the plotting window so the plots display in the R markdown file

par(mar = c(2, 2, 2, 2))
mymlnorm2(x=c(5,7,7,8,10),mu=seq(5,10,length=1000),sig=seq(0.1,4,length=1000),lwd=2,labcex=1)
myboot3(10000,x=c(1,2,3),fun="var",alpha=0.05,xlab="var",col="Purple",cx=1.5)
myclt2(n=10, iter=10000)
ntickets(200, .02, .95)
```
